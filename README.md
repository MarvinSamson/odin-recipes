First HTML Project

This project will demonstrate the basic HTML concepts I have learned from The Odin Project up to 'Project: Recipes' in the Foundations Course. 

This includes HTML Boilerplate, links and imagess, lists, text fonts, file and directory systems, git and github, elements and tags.

Throughout this project, I will practice good commit message habits.
